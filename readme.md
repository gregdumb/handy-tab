## A New Tab Extension for Chrome

None of the existing extensions behaved the way I wanted them to, so I made this one.

[Download it on the Chrome web store.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/utilitab/poodedipoelbijcbigkmbgpjipbjjhil)

### Features:
* Add/delete shortcut links for easy access to commonly used sites
* Set custom images for your shortcuts
* Shortcuts sync across logged-in chrome sessions
* Includes links to Chrome Settings, History, and Extensions
